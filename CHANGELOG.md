### New vertical hubs: Weddings, Corporate Events, Walks

**Summary**
Launched three new primary hub pages based on dedicated strategy research docs. Each hub is a publishing-ready editorial navigation surface with strong metadata, FAQ schema, CollectionPage schema, internal linking, and copy that follows the Peninsula Insider tone and editorial approach.

**Files created**
- `next/src/pages/weddings/index.astro`
- `next/src/pages/corporate-events/index.astro`
- `next/src/pages/walks/index.astro`

**Files modified**
- `next/src/pages/sitemap.xml.ts` — added `weddings`, `corporate-events`, `walks` to sitemap section loop (priority 0.9)

**Pages added**
- `/weddings/` — Mornington Peninsula Weddings hub with venue-type nav, by-town intel, planning framework, guest-weekend section, FAQ, and internal links to stay/eat/wine/spa
- `/corporate-events/` — Corporate Retreats & Events hub with format guide (executive retreat through large conference), locality intelligence, programme logic, planning checklist, FAQ
- `/walks/` — Walks hub with editorial walk selector, long/short walk experience grids, walk+experience pairings, specific trail characterisations, audience-specific guidance, practical notes, FAQ

**Why it matters**
All three verticals identified as high-intent, high-commercial-value expansion clusters with clear editorial differentiation opportunity vs competitors. Each hub is built to serve search intent, LLM retrieval, and the PI audience. Internal linking to existing site sections (stay, eat, wine, spa, golf, explore, dog-friendly, places) activates the existing content equity for the new verticals.

**Architecture notes**
- Walks hub integrates with existing `experiences` collection walk entries for ExperienceCard grids
- Weddings and corporate-events hubs filter `articles` by tag for dynamic journal content (tags `weddings`, `wedding-venues`, `corporate`, `retreats`, `offsite` — add these tags to relevant articles when publishing)
- No new content collections needed for Phase 1 hub launch
- Nav: new verticals not added to primary Masthead nav (already 7 items) — discoverable via sitemap, search, and internal links from related sections

**Follow-up / next phase**
- Add `weddings`, `wedding-venues` tags to `mornington-peninsula-wedding-venues.astro` article for dynamic article pull on weddings hub
- Commission Phase 2 content per strategy docs (venue-type sub-pages, locality sub-pages, planning guides)
- Build walk selector as interactive Astro component once walk attribute data schema is populated
- Add hero images for weddings and corporate-events hubs (currently using existing explore/vineyard images)

### Town hub expansion (5 towns)
- Sorrento, Red Hill, Flinders, Mornington, Rye: keyword-targeted titles, handcrafted meta descriptions, 3 FAQ Q&As each (15 new structured answers total)
- Other place pages retain generic title template — enhancement is scoped to priority towns

### Internal linking improvements
- VenueCard: place label now links to /places/{slug} (every venue card site-wide)
- ExperienceCard: place label now links to /places/{slug}
- PlaceDetailTemplate: eat, wine, stay sections now link to best-of editorial ranking pages

### What's On mood filter fix
- "Browse by mood" chips (Family Saturday, Rainy Day, Worth The Drive, etc.) linked to #lens-{key} anchors that didn't exist — counts were shown but sections weren't rendered
- Added event sections for each non-empty lens filter with full EventCard grids

### Files changed
- `next/src/pages/places/[slug].astro` — title overrides, description overrides, FAQ schema for 5 towns
- `next/src/components/VenueCard.astro` — place label → clickable link
- `next/src/components/ExperienceCard.astro` — place label → clickable link
- `next/src/components/PlaceDetailTemplate.astro` — best-of ranking links in eat/wine/stay sections
- `next/src/pages/whats-on/index.astro` — lens event sections rendered

### Follow-up
- Build output (`dist/`) has not been copied to live site root — next deploy should sync these
- The mobile-fixes, newsletter-enhance, and scroll-animations CSS/JS are only in the built output, not in the Astro build pipeline yet
- Consider adding FAQ schema to remaining town pages as they become priority

### Summary
SERP snippet optimisation pass + domain correction + GA tag + mobile UX fixes + scroll animations + newsletter UX.

### SEO: Domain correction (critical)
- Fixed `peninsularinsider.com.au` → `peninsulainsider.com.au` across 613 built HTML files + 27 Astro source files
- All canonical URLs, OG tags, schema breadcrumbs, and article URLs were pointing to a non-existent domain
- Sitemap corrected and accepted by Google Search Console

### SEO: Homepage rewrite
- Title: "Peninsula Insider — The Mornington Peninsula, as insiders know it" → "Mornington Peninsula Guide 2026 — Best Restaurants, Wineries & Things to Do | Peninsula Insider"
- Description rewritten with target keywords + freshness signal
- Added FAQPage schema (3 Qs: what MP is known for, distance from Melbourne, best time to visit)

### SEO: FAQ schema added to 4 pages
- `/explore/best-walks` — best walk, easy walks, coastal walking
- `/stay/best-accommodation` — best place to stay, cost, Sorrento vs Red Hill
- `/journal/mornington-peninsula-in-autumn` — autumn visit, what to do, swimming
- `/journal/dog-friendly-mornington-peninsula` — dogs on beaches, cafes, staying with dogs

### GA tag: `G-0MR9YVZ9NW` → `G-DBL14DE975` (all pages + BaseLayout.astro)

### UX: Mobile hamburger menu
- `backdrop-filter` on `.masthead` trapped `position:fixed` mobile nav — moved nav outside `<header>` in DOM
- Created `_astro/mobile-fixes.css`: `overflow-x:clip` on html, fixed header on mobile, overflow containment

### UX: Newsletter subscribe
- Replaced Beehiiv iframe with native form + SVG checkmark confirmation animation
- `_astro/newsletter-enhance.js` + `.css` — auto-upgrades all embeds, graceful iframe fallback

### UX: Scroll animations
- `_astro/scroll-animations.js` + `.css` — Intersection Observer reveals, staggered cards, hero parallax
- `prefers-reduced-motion` fully respected

### Files changed
- `next/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`, `next/src/pages/index.astro`, `next/src/pages/explore/best-walks.astro`, `next/src/pages/stay/best-accommodation.astro`, `next/src/pages/journal/mornington-peninsula-in-autumn.astro`, `next/src/pages/journal/dog-friendly-mornington-peninsula.astro`, 27 source files (domain), 600+ built HTML files

### Follow-up
- Town hub pages need FAQ schema + stronger intros (Sorrento, Red Hill, Flinders, Mornington, Rye)
- Internal linking pass: venue↔town, best-of↔venue, journal↔places
- Integrate mobile-fixes, newsletter-enhance, scroll-animations into Astro build pipeline
- Copy `dist/` output to live site root to sync source and deployed output

### Summary
